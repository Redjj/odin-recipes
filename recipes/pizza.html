    <p>
      A cheesy casserole with all of your favorite pizza toppings. I like to
      serve this with a salad and garlic bread. The leftovers are great. I have
      prepared this in advance and then taken it to potlucks in a slow cooker
      the next day.

      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles</li>

    </ul>

        Cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink,
        breaking the meat apart into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.
